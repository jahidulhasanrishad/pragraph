        <p>our village, to me, is a dreamland flowing with milk and money. It is full of ever-charming sights, sounds, 
            and beauty. We go to bed with the songs of the birds at night and wake up again with the songs 
            of birds in the morning. It can be viewed as a darling child of nature.
            it seems that nature has adorned our village lavishly with all 
            the stocks of beauties and bounties at her disposal. 
            It has made out village look like a beautiful virgin adorned with 
            eye-catching ornaments, the marvelous beauty. In fact, 
            our village is a thing of beauty and a joy forever.</p>
